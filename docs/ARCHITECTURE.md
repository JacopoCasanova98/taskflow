# TaskFlow Architecture

## Overview

TaskFlow is a full-stack application organized as a single repository. It separates the backend, frontend, infrastructure, and project documentation so each concern can evolve independently while remaining coordinated.

## Components and responsibilities

### Backend

The `backend/` directory contains the Java 21 and Spring Boot application. It is responsible for server-side business behavior, API delivery, data access, and integration with the PostgreSQL database.

#### Package conventions

- Backend code is organized primarily by feature. Each feature package owns its entity, repository, service, controller, DTOs, and mappers as needed.
- Controllers handle HTTP/API concerns and request validation. Services contain use cases and business orchestration. Repositories handle persistence access only. Entities represent persisted state, DTOs represent API contracts, and mappers translate between them.
- Feature packages are introduced only when their corresponding feature is implemented. Do not create empty feature packages or global `controller`, `service`, `repository`, `entity`, `dto`, or `mapper` packages.
- `shared` is reserved exclusively for genuinely cross-feature technical concerns. `shared.persistence` contains the persistence foundation; `shared.config`, `shared.error`, and `shared.web` are reserved for cross-cutting configuration, error handling, and HTTP/API behavior respectively.

### Frontend

The `frontend/` directory contains the Angular application. It is responsible for the user-facing experience and communication with the backend through its exposed API.

### Database

PostgreSQL is the application's persistent data store. Its use, local configuration, and related operational assets are kept separate from application source code.

#### Persistence conventions

- Persistent entities extend `BaseEntity` (`com.taskflow.shared.persistence`), which provides an application-generated random UUID primary key and `createdAt` / `updatedAt` audit fields.
- Audit values use `Instant`; the application clock, JSON configuration, and Hibernate JDBC timezone are all UTC. Database timestamp columns must use `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` (`timestamptz`).
- JPA auditing is enabled by default. The database-free `test` profile disables it because that profile intentionally has no JPA metamodel.
- Hibernate validates mappings and never creates or updates the schema. Schema changes are introduced only through Flyway migrations in `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration`.
- Migration files use Flyway's versioned format: `V<version>__<description>.sql` (for example, `V1__create_users.sql`). Versions are ordered numerically; descriptions use lowercase words separated by underscores. Existing migrations are immutable.
- Flyway validates migration file names and has cleaning disabled in every application environment.

### Infrastructure

The `infra/` directory contains infrastructure definitions. Docker assets support local containerized development and execution. Directories for Terraform and CloudFormation are reserved for infrastructure definitions when those tools are adopted.

## Repository boundaries

- `docs/` records architecture decisions and project direction.
- `.github/workflows/` is reserved for continuous integration and delivery automation.
- `scripts/` holds repeatable development and operational automation.
- `.agents/` holds repository context and guidance for AI-assisted work.
